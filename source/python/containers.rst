builtin - Tuples, Lists, Sets, Dictionaries
===========================================
There are 4 common collectors available to the users in python;
Tuples, Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries. Each of them have unique features
that work best for different objectives. Before digging into each of them,
let's set a common ground for definitions:

- Mutable: An object that can be changed after it is created

    - list, set, dict

- Immutable: An object that cannot be changed after it is created

    - bool, int, float, str, tuple, frozenset
