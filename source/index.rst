Abstract
--------
This guide is a collection of references and examples for common commands/examples mainly structured around
python, shell (unix/linux/cmd), Microsoft Office related vba and other similar frameworks. All documentation are open source,
and can be found on public domain.

The objective is to layout concepts and examples step by step in a clear and concise manner with emphasis on the "gotchas".

.. note:: Concepts laid out here are not meant to be read from top to bottom. These are merely buckets of concepts.
          For beginners, start with the 10min intro topics. Future revisions may include a beginner/intermediate/advanced walkthrough.

If you enjoy what you find here or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to drop a comment on the github page:
